      Heart monitoring tracks your heart rate (beats per minute) in real time or at set intervals using optical sensors on the back of the smartwatch. Some advanced models also track heart rhythm and detect irregularities like atrial fibrillation (AFib).

    <h2>Benefits of Heart and breath remainders on Smartwatches:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Breathing Rate Tracking:</strong>Measures how many breaths you take per minute, especially during sleep or rest.Can indicate stress, illness, or sleep quality.</li>

      <li><strong>Guided Breathing Sessions:</strong> Built-in mindfulness tools lead you through deep breathing exercises.Helps lower heart rate, calm anxiety, and promote focus.

      <li><strong>Trigger Identification:</strong> Tracking moods alongside contextual information can help identify external and internal factors that influence mood changes.</li>

      <li><strong>Stress Detection via Respiration: </strong> Combined with heart rate and skin sensors to estimate stress levels.

</li>

      <li><strong>Sleep Breathing Analysis</strong> Some smartwatches monitor respiratory rate during sleep to spot irregularities like sleep apnea.</li>

      <li><strong>Heart Rate Variability (HRV):</strong> Measures the variation between heartbeats, useful for stress, recovery, and overall wellness tracking..</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In conclusion,Combining heart, breath, sleep, and activity data provides a holistic view of physical and mental health.Helps users track patterns over time, optimize workouts, reduce stress, and even detect early signs of illness.
