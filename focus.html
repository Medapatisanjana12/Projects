      Focus Mode is a smartwatch feature designed to help users minimize distractions and maintain concentration. It temporarily silences notifications, dims the screen, and limits non-essential functionality to support deep work, meditation, or mindful moments.

    <h2>Benefits of having Focus Mode on Smartwatches:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Notification Silencing:</strong>Blocks or filters incoming notifications (calls, messages, app alerts)</li>

      <li><strong>App Restrictions:</strong> Prevents usage of non-essential apps or restricts to only "focus-friendly" apps (e.g., breathing, timers).</li>

      <li><strong>Custom Timers & Schedules</strong> Users can set specific durations (e.g., 25 min Pomodoro) or automatic schedules (e.g., 10 AM to 1 PM daily).</li>

      <li><strong>Visual Cues: </strong>Displays a minimal or calming watch face, sometimes paired with a countdown timer or mindfulness animation.
</li>

      <li><strong>Smartphone Syncing:</strong> If enabled on the watch, it also triggers Focus Mode on a paired phone (Apple, Samsung, Pixel ecosystems).</li>

      <li><strong>Health Integration:</strong> Often combined with breathwork, meditation, or stress-reduction features.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
